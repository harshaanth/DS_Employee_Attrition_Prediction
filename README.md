# Employee Attrition Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains multiple machine learning projects focused on predicting employee attrition using various classification techniques. Each project applies a different algorithm to analyze employee data and predict whether an employee will leave the organization.

## Project Structure
The repository includes the following projects:
1. **Employee Attrition with Random Forest**: 
   - A Random Forest model is used to predict employee attrition based on various employee attributes.
2. **Employee Attrition with Logistic Regression**: 
   - Logistic Regression is applied to model the likelihood of employee attrition.
3. **Employee Attrition with Multiple Classifiers**: 
   - Various classification models (e.g., Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors) are compared to determine the most effective model for predicting attrition.

## Project Highlights
### Employee Attrition with Random Forest:
